## House Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression

This Folder contains the implementation of a house price prediction model built using a Linear Regression algorithm. The model is designed to predict the price of a house based on various features and attributes. The dataset used for training the model is sourced from a publicly available dataset containing housing details such as area, number of bedrooms, location, age of the house, and more.
## Project Overview 

The goal of this project was to create a model capable of accurately predicting house prices based on relevant features. Linear Regression was used as the predictive model for this task, providing a straightforward and effective approach to understanding the relationship between house features and their prices.

## Key Features
Dataset: The dataset includes multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and house age.

Model: A Linear Regression model was trained to make price predictions based on the input features.

Performance: The model achieved a high accuracy in predicting house prices, with minimal error on the testing dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using linear regression for predicting house prices. The model effectively captures the relationship between the features and the target variable, providing accurate predictions and valuable insights for real estate pricing.
