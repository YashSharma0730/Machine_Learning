Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a model capable of classifying individuals into two categories: diabetic or non-diabetic, using their medical data. Linear Regression was used as the predictive model for this task, with the intention of forecasting the presence or absence of diabetes based on the input features.

Key Features:
Dataset: The dataset used includes various health parameters like age, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.
Model: A simple Linear Regression model was trained to make predictions based on the input features.
Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 95.44% on the testing data, making it highly reliable for predicting diabetes.
How it Works
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing the data if needed, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed training data. The model learns to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the provided features.

Prediction: After training, the model is used to predict diabetes in individuals by providing their medical attributes as inputs. The model outputs a predicted value that can be mapped to a binary classification (diabetic or non-diabetic).

Evaluation: The model is evaluated using various metrics, and an accuracy of 95.44% is achieved on the testing dataset, showing the modelâ€™s reliability in making correct predictions.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using linear regression for medical predictions, specifically in detecting diabetes. Although linear regression is a relatively simple model, it provides a decent accuracy of 95.44%, showcasing its applicability for binary classification tasks in the healthcare domain.

Future Work
Model Optimization: Further improvements could be made by experimenting with other algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines (SVM).
Feature Engineering: Adding more relevant features or improving existing ones could potentially increase the model's accuracy.
