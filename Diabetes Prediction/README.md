## Diabetes Detection Model using Logistic Regression

This Folder contains the implementation of a diabetes detection model built using a Logistic Regression algorithm. The model is designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain medical features and characteristics. The dataset used for training the model is sourced from a publicly available dataset containing various health-related attributes, such as age, BMI, glucose level, insulin levels, and others.

## Project Overview 

The goal of this project was to create a model capable of classifying individuals into two categories: diabetic or non-diabetic, using their medical data. Logistic Regression was used as the predictive model for this task, with the intention of forecasting the presence or absence of diabetes based on the input features.

## Key Features
Dataset: The dataset used includes various health parameters like age, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

Model: A Logistic Regression model was trained to make predictions based on the input features.

Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 95.44% on the testing data, making it highly reliable for predicting diabetes.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using logistic regression for medical predictions, specifically in detecting diabetes. Logistic regression provides a robust and interpretable approach, achieving a strong accuracy of 95.44%, showcasing its applicability for binary classification tasks in the healthcare domain.
