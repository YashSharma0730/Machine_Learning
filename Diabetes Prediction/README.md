## Diabetes Detection Model using Linear Regression

This Folder contains the implementation of a diabetes detection model built using a Linear Regression algorithm. The model is designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain medical features and characteristics. The dataset used for training the model is sourced from a publicly available dataset containing various health-related attributes, such as age, BMI, glucose level, insulin levels, and others.



## Project Overview 

The goal of this project was to create a model capable of classifying individuals into two categories: diabetic or non-diabetic, using their medical data. Linear Regression was used as the predictive model for this task, with the intention of forecasting the presence or absence of diabetes based on the input features.
## Key Features

The dataset used includes various health parameters like age, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more. Model: A simple Linear Regression model was trained to make predictions based on the input features. Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 95.44% on the testing data, making it highly reliable for predicting diabetes. How it Works Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing the data if needed, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
## Model Training

A Linear Regression model is trained on the preprocessed training data. The model learns to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the provided features.


## Prediction

After training, the model is used to predict diabetes in individuals by providing their medical attributes as inputs. The model outputs a predicted value that can be mapped to a binary classification (diabetic or non-diabetic).


## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using various metrics, and an accuracy of 95.44% is achieved on the testing dataset, showing the modelâ€™s reliability in making correct predictions.
